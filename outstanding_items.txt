- name: Send mail for root to a real person
    skipping: [instance] => {
        "changed": false,
        "skip_reason": "Conditional result was False"
    }
=> I suspect that this is ok ...
==> ssh into container and look at "/etc/aliases" for ""root: {{ default_mail_recipient }}""

==> Question for all these: how can we make sure that the test is not skipped, or does it matter?
